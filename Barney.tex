\subsection{\glsdesc{RBV}} % Section voor Barney

\Gls{RBV} came as a response to~\cite{Porter:1980} a decade later.~\Gls{RBV} argued that a firms strategic advantage is depended on it's heterogeneous resources (a bundle of all assets, knowledge, and capabilities) which have to be
\begin{enumerate}[(a)]
\item must be valuable, in the sense that it exploit opportunities and/or neutralises threats in a firm’s environment
\item must be rare among a firm’s current and potential competition, 
\item must be imperfectly imitable
\item  there cannot be strategically equivalent substitutes for this resource that are valuable but neither rare or imperfectly imitable 
\end{enumerate} 
In contrast to~\gls{InBV} the theory of~\cite{Barney:1991} is~\emph{extrospective}. 
The theory by~\cite{Barney:1991}  has been given the acronym VRIN\@.\\
