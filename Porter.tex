\subsection{\glsdesc{InBV}} %Chapter Porter

To understand the early thinking in strategy research we have to look at Porter's diamond model (See figure \ref{fig:Diamond}) and his five forces (see figure~\ref{fig:5forces}).  


%% Forces
The five forces model shows how to determine a company's competitive environment, and thus it's \gls{CA}, which affects profitability. 
The bargaining power of buyers and suppliers affect ability to increase prices and manage costs, respectively. 
Vise versa a supplier can have bargaining power over its customers. Low-entry barriers attract new competition, while high-entry barriers discourage it. 
Industry rivalry is likely to be higher when several companies are vying for the same customers, and intense rivalry tend to have a price eroding effect

%Diamond
%Government policies can influence the components of the diamond model. For example, some economists suggest that lower income taxes stimulate consumer demand, which leads to higher sales and profits. 
The forces at work in the diamond give an overview of 

Countries that invest in education have a skilled workforce, which helps companies engage in research and development. 
The presence of supporting industries in close proximity to manufacturing companies can reduce input costs and increase profits. 
Supporting industries include raw materials suppliers and component manufacturers. 
A competitive industry structure is also important because companies that can survive tough competition at home are usually able to withstand even tougher competition in a global business environment.
